Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a bank customer will leave the bank (churn) or not, based on various input features.

üîç Overview

- Built and trained an ANN using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Used StandardScaler for preprocessing.
- Saved and loaded the trained model (`ANN.h5`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`) for inference.
- Performed inference on new data and predicted churn outcome.
-  üìÇ Files

- `Ann_inference.py` ‚Äì Loads the scaler and ANN model, runs inference on test input.
- `ANN.h5` ‚Äì Trained ANN model.
- `scaler.pkl` ‚Äì Pre-fitted StandardScaler for consistent input scaling.
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì Python package dependencies.
